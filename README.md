# Contextual GitHub Workflows with Cursor Commands

Hi there! 

In this repository, you can find the Cursor Commands and slides from my presentation at the Cursor Meetup in Hamburg, which was on the 19th of November, 2025. 

There's some great documentation on the Cursor website about the ins-and-outs of Cursor Comands too, which you can find [here](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/chat/commands).

Have fun!
